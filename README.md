# grab-bag

A muckabout app for learning Clojure with.

If it's running anywhere live at the moment it'll be [here](http://grab-bag.herokuapp.com/).

I was also able to get it running quite easily on Ubuntu by following the instructions [here](http://pietervogelaar.nl/ubuntu-12-04-install-jetty-9), doing `lein ring uberwar`, renaming the jar file as a war (?) and copying it up into `/opt/jetty/webapps`.
