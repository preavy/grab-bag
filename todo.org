TODO

1. Sort out namespaces.
2. Make the web page call the pasted-in stuff.
3. You can call grab with fake keys and it will just insert a record.
4. Grab should do some checks.
5. Should choices be passed in?
6. Write (which I do need to think about a bit more):
   transaction
     update-map(grab choice person (read-map))
7. Write db functions (can write these now, because I have pg installed)
   1. update-map
   2. read-map
